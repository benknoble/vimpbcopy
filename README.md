# vimpbcopy

[![This project is considered stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-success.svg)](https://benknoble.github.io/status/stable/)

Yank text to the clipboard with `<C-y>`!

## Usage

By default, `<C-y>` is overridden in Normal and Visual mode to be a yank
operator.  So `<C-y>` will yank the lines of a paragraph to the clipboard.

You can configure the mapping: see `:help vimpbcopy-configuration`.
